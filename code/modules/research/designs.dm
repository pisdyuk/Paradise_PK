/*
For the materials datum, it assumes you need reagents unless specified otherwise. To designate a material that isn't a reagent,
you use one of the material IDs below. These are NOT ids in the usual sense (they aren't defined in the object or part of a datum),
they are simply references used as part of a "has materials?" type proc. They all start with a $ to denote that they aren't reagents.
The currently supporting non-reagent materials:
- MAT_METAL (/obj/item/stack/metal).
- MAT_GLASS (/obj/item/stack/glass).
- MAT_PLASMA (/obj/item/stack/plasma).
- MAT_SILVER (/obj/item/stack/silver).
- MAT_GOLD (/obj/item/stack/gold).
- MAT_URANIUM (/obj/item/stack/uranium).
- MAT_DIAMOND (/obj/item/stack/diamond).
- MAT_BANANIUM (/obj/item/stack/bananium).
- MAT_TRANQUILLITE (/obj/item/stack/tranquillite).
(Insert new ones here)

Don't add new keyword/IDs if they are made from an existing one (such as rods which are made from metal). Only add raw materials.

Design Guidlines
- When adding new designs, check rdreadme.dm to see what kind of things have already been made and where new stuff is needed.
- A single sheet of anything is 2000 units of material. Materials besides metal/glass require help from other jobs (mining for
other types of metals and chemistry for reagents).
- Add the AUTOLATHE tag to
